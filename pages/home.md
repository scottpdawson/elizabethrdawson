I am currently a college senior, studying Vocal Music Education at the [Ithaca College School of Music](https://www.ithaca.edu/academics/school-music).

When Iâ€™m not studying and practicing, I enjoy throwing [ceramics](/pottery), cooking, baking, downhill skiing, spending time with family and pets (check out [Phoebe's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/phoebe.the.bunny/)), going for hikes with friends, and working out.

I work at [Finger Lakes Running Company](https://www.fingerlakesrunningco.com/) in Ithaca where I help people find shoes and gear that is just right for them with my awesome coworkers. I also teach group fitness classes at [FLX Fitclub](https://flxfitclub.com/).
