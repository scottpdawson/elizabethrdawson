I am majoring in Vocal Music Education with a concentration in Piano at the [Ithaca College School of Music](https://www.ithaca.edu/academics/school-music) in Ithaca, New York. I have been playing piano for 14 years and am most currently studying with [Dr. Vadim Serebryany](https://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/vserebryany). I enjoy playing solo piano, and accompanying vocalists and choirs of all different ages. You can see (and hear!) my [current projects and performances on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7cOJzRu6yNu0tx3ImuNSA).
