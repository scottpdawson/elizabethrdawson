I graduated from the [Ithaca College School of Music](https://www.ithaca.edu/academics/school-music) with a degree in Music Education in the spring of 2023, with piano being my primary instrument. I enjoy playing solo piano and accompanying vocalists and choirs of all different ages. You can see (and hear!) [current projects and performances on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7cOJzRu6yNu0tx3ImuNSA).
